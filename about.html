      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p><em>Fit to a Tee</em> is a Vancouver-based t-shirt company that makes limited edition, short run, one of a kind t-shirts. We design unique styles which are only available for one month, so that everything stays nice and fresh. We want you to look great in a t-shirt that few other people can call their own, and we want you to feel great about wearing it.</p>
